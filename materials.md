On this page I will be posting and updating lectures, exercises and materials for the current year brushup.

## Shell (Command Line Interfaces)
Have a look at the shell exercises [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/3d8BeanH). 

The repo contains 3 folders corresponding to different assignments, one handout "handout_bash.html", and one ".gitignore" file (it makes git to omit several files from consideration at all). In the handout you can find a lot of information not only about Bourne again Shell, but also about Git and GitHub, and Servers.

Solutions: [scripting](./docs/shell-solutions/scripting.tar.gz), [whodunit](./docs/shell-solutions/whodunit-solution.sh).
