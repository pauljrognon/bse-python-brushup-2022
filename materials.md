On this page I will be posting and updating lectures, exercises and materials for the current year brushup.

## How to complete the tests
To complete the test:  
1. Accept the assignment.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. Complete the exercises\[.R / .py\] script.
4. Add, commit and push your changes using `git` commands.
5. Check that your push is successful. 
6. You can see the autograder result in the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repo. You will see a "workflow" with a message of your commit, just press it.  
Only the latest push before the deadline is taken into account!

*ATTENTION:* do not use `setwd()` in your code in R.

## Shell (Command Line Interfaces)
Have a look at the shell exercises [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/3d8BeanH). 

The repo contains 3 folders corresponding to different assignments, one handout "handout_bash.html", and one ".gitignore" file (it makes git to omit several files from consideration at all). In the handout you can find a lot of information not only about Bourne again Shell, but also about Git and GitHub, and Servers.

Solutions: [scripting](./docs/shell-solutions/scripting.tar.gz), [whodunit](./docs/shell-solutions/whodunit-solution.sh).

### Test Python
Complete the test: ["Python: Test"](https://classroom.github.com/a/369Bl5Gk)  
Deadline: 20/09/22 23:59  
Grading: each exercise gives 10 points  
Passing grade: 60 / 110

## R
All the main materials are incorporated into a GitHub Classroom assignment: ["R: Tutorial"](https://classroom.github.com/a/j3WyUiaa). 

You can find the in-class handouts there together with some practical exercises. For more information, please read the README file in the repo.

I will also post an extra repo a bit later which will contain materials on linear models in R.
