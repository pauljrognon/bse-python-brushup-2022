There is a bewildering number of online Python tutorials and books. Here are some recommendations:

**Online resources**

-   [codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python): interactive tutorials for Python.
-   Software Carpentry Python lessons: [Programming with Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) and [Plotting with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/). They are a bit more advanced than the code academy pages, and not interactive.

**Book**

-   [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake Van der Plas: Python programming oriented to data science with an online version and Colab notebooks.
