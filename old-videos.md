To help you complete the assignments, you will find a set of recorded lectures below that introduce you to the concepts needed. Along with the videos, you will find a link to the slides in HTML format. You can also find a PDF version of the slides [in this Github respository](https://github.com/Jordi-Llorens/computing-brushup-21){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

## 0. Introduction to Python + Variables

This module gives a brief introduction to Python and shows how variable assignment works in Python.

## 2. Conditionals and Raising Exceptions

This module introduces control flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`, etc.) and shows us how to use control flow to raise our own exceptions when things don't look as expected.

## 3. Lists and Loops

This module introduces the basic building blocks for iterating in Python: the list and the for loop, as well as three basic patterns for working with lists: map, filter, reduce.

## 4. Tuples and Dictionaries

This module introduces two important data structures, the Tuple and the Dictionary, and introduces patterns for working with lists of tuples and lists of dictionaries.

### List Operations and Tuples
