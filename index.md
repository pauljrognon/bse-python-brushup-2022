* 10 minute break after the first hour.

**Material**
* In section [Material](https://paulrognonvael.github.io/bse-python-brushup-2022/material.html), you will find Jupyter Notebooks to be covered in class and some exercises.
* In section [Complements](https://paulrognonvael.github.io/bse-python-brushup-2022/complements.html), you will find videos from a longer introductory course on Python by Nandan Rao. They offer complementary explanations of topics covered in our brush-up and some topics not covered in our brushup.

**Technical requirements**  
Please bring your laptop to class. To run the notebooks you can either use:
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (simpler, runs in the cloud, need a Google account e.g. BSE account): `File > Upload notebook` and upload brush-up `.ipynb` notebooks. Alternatively, you can create a new notebook by doing `File > New notebook`. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) is an introductory video about Google Colab.  

OR 
 
* Jupyter Notebook (runs on your computer): you can install Python and Jupyter Notebook by installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution. Alternatively, you can install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) separately. Launch Jupyter Notebook, find and click on the brush-up `.ipynb` notebooks to open them.

**About me**
* PhD student in statistical learning advised by David Rossell (UPF) and Piotr Zwiernik (U. of Toronto, UPF).
* Interests: high-dimensional statistics, graphs, probabilistic machine learning, applications in genomics.

**Comments**
* Please ask any question you might have.
* Python is one of the most popular programming languages. You will find plenty of ressources on internet and in particular on Stack Overflow. Just google your doubts!
