**Technical requirements**  
Please bring your laptop to class. To run the notebooks:
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) (simpler, runs in the cloud, need a Google account e.g. BSE account): `File > Upload notebook` and upload brush-up `.ipynb` notebooks. Alternatively, you can create a new notebook by doing `File > New notebook`. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) is an introductory video about Google Colab.
* Jupyter Notebook (runs on your computer): you can install Python and Jupyter Notebook by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Alternatively, you can install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) separately. Launch Jupyter Notebook, find and click on the brush-up `.ipynb` notebooks to open them.

**About me**

* Interests: high-dimensional statistics, graphs, probabilistic machine learning, applications in genomics.

**Comments**
* Please ask any question you might have.
* Python is one of the most popular programming languages. You will find plenty of ressources on internet and in particular on Stack Overflow. Just google your doubts!
