Preferably, letters in a name should be lower case, although it is not necessary. Note that names (or identifiers) in Python are case-sensitive. Also, a variable name cannot start with a number.  \n",

For example, `car_speed = 50`. From this example, you can also see that it can be hard to understand a code without any additional comments. So you can comment your code using hash character `#`, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`car_speed = 50  # note that everywhere in the program speed is measured in km/h`. \n",
