You can have the three of them by installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution. Alternatively, you can install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) separately. To open an existing `.ipynb` notebook: launch Jupyter Notebook (opens a tab in your web browser), and, on the welcome screen, navigate to your `.ipynb` file and click on it. Alternatively, use the Upload button in the top right corner of the welcome screen."

    "Shortly, notebooks are documents that combine live code, equations, narrative text and visualizations. In a single document, you can write code, show the code output, write markdown type content, show text and visual outputs. Jupyter/`.ipynb` notebooks are a type of notebooks originally developped for Python and have extension `.ipynb`. The document you are seeing is an example of `.ipynb` notebook converted to a PDF document.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Edit mode (indicated by a green border around the cell in Jupyter Notebook application) can be accessed by double clicking on a cell. It is the default mode when a new cell is created. \n",
    "- The command mode (indicated by a blue border around the cell in Jupyter Notebook application) can be accessed by pressing `CRTL+m` when you are in edit mode (`Esc` works too in the Jupyter Notebook application). The command mode lets use you shorcuts: press `m` to convert a cell to text type, `b` to create a new cell below for example. To delete a cell, used shorcut `d` in command mode in Google Colab, `dd` in command mode in Jupyter Notebook application.\n",

    "An easy way to run an `.ipynb` notebook with R code in the Jupyter Notebook application is through Anaconda. Launch the Anaconda Navigator, click on Environments on the left, then click on the Create button at the bottom to create a new environment. In the window that opens, choose a name for your environment, tick both R and Python boxes and press create. From now on you will have two different environments set up for your programming with Anaconda: base (root) and the one you have just created. Go back to the home of Anaconda Navigator, in the top bar \"Applications on   \", select your new environment. After it is fully loaded, click on the launch button of the Jupyter Notebook application. You should be able to open and run .ipynb notebooks with R code."
