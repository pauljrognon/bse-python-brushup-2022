    "### What is R?\n",
    "\n",
    "R refers to both:\n",
    "- A programming language.\n",
    "- A program (it runs on a computer). The program's purpose is to interpret the language and convert it into instructions for a computer.\n",
    "(Like Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Current release of R is version 4.2.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "R does have a graphical interface: [R-GUI console](https://cran.r-project.org/). In R-GUI you can submit R language commands one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time you will want to submit a series of commands (your code) and thus you will write a *script* with extension `.R`. For example you could write the following script and save it with extension `.R`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "message <- \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "print(message)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then to execute your script, open the GUI and run `source('path to your .R file')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write a script with any basic text editor. However it is more convenient to use an IDE (integrated development environment). The most popular IDE for R is [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/). Shortly, RStudio is an interface with four quadrants: one for editing a script, one displaying the commands run and their printed output (the console), one showing the objects in the environment, one that displays the working directory, plots, packages and help. [Here](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/01-basicbasics-1/) is a tour of RStudio. Note that RStudio now supports Python programming too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R in Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run R code in Jupyter notebooks. You can do it through the Jupyter Notebook application, see this [guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/navigator/tutorials/r-lang/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab can also run Jupyter notebooks with R code. To create a R notebook in Colab, enter this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=r). If you go to `Runtime`>`Change runtime type`, you will see the Runtime type is now set to 'R'.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Complete user manual: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html.\n",
    "* As a beginner, I recommend to start coding your scripts using [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).\n",
    "* As you gain experience and deal with more demanding projects, you can work directly on the (current release: `R 4.2.2`), or even on the Terminal"

    "1. **Reproducibility** is everything: so you and others can keep track of your analysis, it is important to conserve your code. Develop and save your code in an `R` script (file with extension `.R`) or a notebook (Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb`, R markdown `.rmd`). Commands submitted to the console are **NOT** saved.\n",
    "2. Make your code as **robust** as possible: be conservative and write safe code, taking all possibilities into account. Being lazy today will cause problems tomorrow.\n",
    "2. **Comment your code thoroughly** and clarify everything, someone else might read it and needs to know what's happening (even yourself in the future)\n",
    "3. Follow a **style guide** and do it **consistently**: spacing, indenting, format..., just like you do writing natural language. Hadley Wickham, a leading developper of R solutions, published his own [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). It's an example that you can tweak to make it your own: just stick to the basics, stay consistent and write as if it were to be read. Remember: **clean code = happy programmer**."

It works well for simple commands, but the framework above is more flexible and can deal with complex operations. Feel free to use it though! Try: `subset(airquality, Temp > 80, select = c(Ozone, Temp))`.\n",
    "*   Notice I never modify the original object I am subsetting. It is important that when you subset that you don't over-write previously existing objects (and, in particular, the object you are subsetting), unless you recursively subset one particular object. These operations are **irreversible**, in the sense that if you over-write the object being subsetted, the information that was cut out cannot be re-used anywhere else in your code. Often times this is not desirable. If you have memory problems in your CPU, you have to balance this with keeping as few possible copies of the data as possible, but try to keep the originals intact in your workspace."
